# WeeklyChallengeRefactoring

# <WeeklyChallengeRefactoring>

## Description

- This project entails refactoring HTML and CSS source code as a weekly assignment to better understand and implement semantic HTML and Search Engine Optimization best pratices. 
- Though the initial source code deployed just fine, it presented the problem of not being as readable and user friendly. 
- I utilized semantic HTML elements to refactor and consolidate code where necessary, thus making the code easier to interpet and potentially refactor where needed.
